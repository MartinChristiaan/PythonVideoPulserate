# Python Video Pulserate using the chrominance method
Python implementation of a pulse rate monitor using rPPG from video with the chrominance method.
It uses OpenCV for face detection, for skin selection two methods are available. Skin classification using a hsv color range and forehead estimation. Due to the state of the art chrominance method the system is fairly motion robust. Furthermore, this framework also features a GUI that depicts the measured raw rPPG signal and the resulting fourier spectrum. 

# Dependencies
* Python3
* Numpy.
* Matplotlib. 
* OpenCV
* SciPy

For GUI:
* PyQt5
* PyQtgraph


# GUI

Execute the rPPG_GUI.py to launch the GUI. Edit the source variable in order to select the desired input. The GUI uses PyQtgraph in order to display measurent data in real time. The video source as well as de skin selection methods can be set within the python script.  Exact user instructions can be found within the Python file.  

# .Mat Extraction

The Raw rPPG signal from an offline recording can also be extracted to a .Mat file so it can be processed with Matlab, usefull for more detailed analysis. Run the mat_exporter.py for this functionality.

# Other files
rPPG_preprocessing.py contains some of the functions used for face tracking and skin classification.
rPPG_proccessing_realtime.py contains the signal processing (normalization, detrending, bandpass filtering and the chrominance method ) used to improve the signal.
